# agile-board
I have used Angular and Bootstrap to create a basic Agile Board. After cloning the project you can run
```
npm install
ng serve
```

The page will load with some dummy data. You can use "Clear Data" button at the top to clear the records and start afresh. Or if you want to re-start with dummy data, you can use "Dummy Data" button. Instead of showing modal for data entry, i have made the cards editable. For now we can only add the data once. But in future we can make the cards editable.
